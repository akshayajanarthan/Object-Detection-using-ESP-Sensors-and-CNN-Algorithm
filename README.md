         Image Classification With Convolutional Neural Network. And Build A CNN Model To Classify Images Into Different Category Such As Animals, Vehicles, Or Household Items Using Esp 32 Cam.

**ABSTRACT:**

               Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network With Esp32-Cam Involves Leveraging The Esp32-Cam Board’s Capabilities To Process Images And Classify Them Using Machine Learning Models.
              The Esp33 Camera Modules Is Programmed Through The FDTI Module, Requiring Setup In The Ardunio Ide. The Project Integrated With Machine Learning Approaches With Esp32 Cam To Capture And Classify Images Using A Trained Model, Enhancing Its Functionality Beyond Basic Image Capture.

**PROCESS:**

•	Data Collection :- gather dataset containing humans, animals, and household items.
•	Data Preprocessing:-preprocessing the images by resizing them to a consistent size and normalizing pixel values. 
•	Model Architecture: design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification
•	Training: training a CNN model according to your dataset.
•	Model Conversion: convert the model to ESP32 microcontroller.
•	Esp32 Integration:- write code to capture images from a camera module attached to esp32- cam
